\section{Conclusion}

We expect that the performance of our approach, compared to traditional
RAG-based approach, will depend on the extent to which the structure of the
domain-specific data resembles the way it is used in an application. When the
structure is similar, we expect RAG-based approaches to exhibit comparable
performance, because the relevant data can be easily found using standard
retrieval metrics based on the distance between embeddings. However, when the
structure of the data is different, we expect our approach to yield better
results: the "pre-processing" of the data via agentic workflows and subsequent
fine-tuning on that data should hopefully allow the model to memorise the data
in a way such that it can use it effectively later.
