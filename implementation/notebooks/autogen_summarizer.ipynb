Image synthesis by knowledge transfer. Unlike previous works using GANs as base model and test transfer on relatively narrow visual domains, we transfer knowledge of generative vision transformers [7, 15] to a wide range of visual domains, including natural (e.g., scene, flower), specialized (e.g., satellite, medical), and structured (e.g., road scenes, infograph, sketch) with a few training images. Notably, the prompt tuning significantly improves the prior best FID on two benchmarks ImageNet (85.9!16.3) and Places (71.3!24.2). **Abstract** _Learning generative image models from various domains_ _efficiently needs transferring knowledge from an image syn-_ _thesis model trained on a large dataset. We present a recipe_ _for learning vision transformers by generative knowledge_ _transfer. We base our framework on generative vision trans-_ _formers representing an image as a sequence of visual to-_ _kens with the autoregressive or non-autoregressive trans-_ _formers. To adapt to a new domain, we employ prompt tun-_ _ing, which prepends learnable tokens called prompts to the_ _image token sequence and introduces a new prompt design_ _for our task. We study on a variety of visual domains with_ _varying amounts of training images. We show the effective-_ _ness of knowledge transfer and a significantly better image_ _generation quality.[1]_ **1. Introduction** Image synthesis has witnessed tremendous progress re cently with the advancement of deep generative models [2, 1https://github.com/google-research/generative_ transfer 12, 20, 67, 69]. An ideal image synthesis system generates diverse, plausible, and novel scenes capturing the appearance of objects and depicting their interactions. The success of image synthesis does heavily rely on the availability of a large amount of diverse training data [73]. Transfer learning, a cornerstone invention in deep learn ing, has proven indispensable in an array of computer vision tasks, including classification [35], object detection [18,19], image segmentation [23, 24], etc. However, transfer learning is not widely used for image synthesis. While recent efforts have shown success in transferring knowledge from pre-trained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models [46, 60, 71, 76], their demonstrations are limited to narrow visual domains, e.g., faces or cars [46, 76], as in Fig. 1, or requiring a non-trivial amount of training data [60, 71] to transfer to out-of-distribution domains. In this work, we approach transfer learning for image synthesis using generative vision transformers, an emerging class of image synthesis models, such as DALL·E [53], Taming Transformer [15], MaskGIT [7], CogView [13], N UWA [[¨] 75], Parti [79], among others, which excel in im ----- age synthesis tasks. We closely follow the recipe of transfer learning for image classification [35], in which a source model is first trained on a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet) and then transferred to a diverse collection of downstream tasks. Except, in our setting, the input and output are reversed and the model generates images from a class label. We present a transfer learning framework using prompt _tuning [38,40]. While the technique has been used for trans-_ fer learning of discriminative models for vision tasks [1,29], we appear to be the first to adopt prompt tuning for trans_fer learning of image synthesis. To this end, we propose a_ parameter-efficient design of a prompt token generator that admits condition variables (e.g., class), a key for controllable image synthesis neglected in prompt tuning for discriminative transfer [29, 38]. We also introduce a marquee header prompt that engineers learned prompts to enhance generation diversity while retaining the generation quality. We conduct a large-scale study to understand the me chanics of transfer learning for generative vision transformers. Two types of generative transformers – AutoRegressive _(AR) and Non-AutoRegressive (NAR) – are examined. AR_ transformers (e.g., DALL·E [53], Taming Transformer [15], Parti [79]) generate image tokens sequentially with an autoregressive language model. NAR transformers (e.g., MaskGIT [7], MUSE [6]) or diffusion models (e.g., Imagen [58], Latent Diffusion [57]) decompose image synthesis as a series of refinement or denoising steps. In this work, we study transfer learning of class-conditional AR [15] and NAR [7] transformer models trained on ImageNet to comply with existing transfer learning settings [60, 71]. In addition to investigating proposed prompt tuning, we also conduct an analysis of two other transfer learning methods, i.e. full fine-tuning and adapter tuning, in the context of generative transfer learning using vision transformers. We compare their strengths and weaknesses in Sec. 4.1. Our study shows that generative vision transformers with prompt tuning outperform state-of-the-art methods using GANs [60, 71] by a vast margin, which is verified on 19 tasks of diverse visual distributions and drastically different amounts of training data in VTAB [81]. Fig. 1 compares domains, showing the great expansion of downstream domains to what is achieved by previous works. On the onmanifold domains on which previous studies have focused, our method slashes the prior state-of-the-art in FID from 71 to 24 on Places [85] and 86 to 16 on Animal Face [61] datasets. Moreover, our method shows highly-competitive data efficiency, generating diverse images following the target distribution when trained from a few images per class. In summary, our contributions are as follows: _• We present a generative visual transfer learning frame-_ work for vision transformers with prompt tuning [38], proposing a new prompt token generator design. _• We conduct a large-scale empirical study for genera-_ tive transfer learning to validate our proposed prompt tuning and relevant transfer learning methods (e.g., full fine-tuning, adapter tuning) on several visual domains (e.g., VTAB) and scenarios (e.g., few-shot). We show state-of-the-art image synthesis performance. _• To our knowledge, we are first to propose the use of_ prompt tuning for transfer learning of generative transformers. Importantly, we provide the quantitative evidence on the necessity of generative knowledge transfer on VTAB [81], the common and challenging transfer learning benchmark. **2. Preliminary** **2.1. Generative Vision Transformers** This paper uses generative vision transformers to denote vision transformers for image synthesis. Broadly, there are two types of generative transformers, AutoRegressive (AR) and Non-AutoRegressive (NAR) transformers, both consisting of two stages – image quantization and decoding. The two models share the same first stage: image quantization by a Vector-Quantized (VQ) auto-encoder [15, 54, 67, 78]. The VQ encoder converts image patches into indices (or tokens) in a codebook. The 2D image is then flattened into a 1D sequence to which a special token indicating its class label is prepended.

Our method transfers knowledge from generative vision transformers (e.g., autoregressive [15] or non-autoregressive [7]) trained on a large dataset to various visual domains by prepending learnable prompt tokens (green) to visual tokens (blue). AR and NAR transformers differ in the second stage. AR transformers [8, 13, 15, 53, 75, 79], such as DALL·E [53], Taming Transformer [15], learn an AR decoder on the flattened token sequence to generate image tokens sequentially from previously generated tokens. As in Fig. 2, the generation follows a raster scan ordering, generating tokens from left to right, line-by-line. Finally, the generated tokens are mapped to the pixel space using the VQ decoder. ----- |Transformer|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6| |---|---|---|---|---|---| |Transformer|||||| ||||||| |𝝨 F B x S x P x F 1 x 1 x 1 x F B x 1 x P x F 1 x S x P x F MLP MLP MLP C P F class / instance position factor|Col2| |---|---| S B x S x P MLPT D decode (a) Baseline prompt token generators of length _S conditioned on class._ (b) The proposed parameter efficient prompt token generator via factorization of class / instance and position. ⊕ is an element-wise sum, ⊙ is an element-wise product, ⌃F is a sum over F dimension.

(c) Number of parameters for prompt token generators with respect to the sequence length (S), while setting P = 768, D = 768, and C = 100 with different number of factors F . NAR or diffusion models, including DALL·E 2 [52], MaskGIT [7], Latent Diffusion [57], or Imagen [58], decompose image synthesis as a series of refinement or denoising steps. For prompt tuning, we need a NAR model with the transformer backbone [7, 17, 21, 36, 37, 39, 83], and use a leading NAR image transformer called MaskGIT [7]. NAR transformers are trained on the masked modeling proxy task [11]. For inference, the model adopts a nonautoregressive decoding method to synthesize an image in a few steps [7, 21, 36, 39]. As in Fig. 2, the NAR transformer starts from a blank canvas with all tokens masked, and generates an image in 8 steps or so. In each step, it predicts all tokens in parallel and retains the ones with the highest prediction scores. The remaining tokens are masked out and predicted in the next iteration. NAR transformers [7, 39] have shown faster inference than AR transformers. **2.2. Prompt Tuning** Prompt tuning [38, 40] is introduced recently in natural language processing as a way of efficiently adapting pretrained large language models to downstream tasks. Here, prompt is a sequence of additional tokens prepended to a token sequence. In prompt engineering [3], their values are often chosen by heuristic. On the other hand, in prompt tuning [38, 40], tokens are parameterized by learnable parameters and their parameters are updated via gradient descent to adapt transformers to the downstream tasks. Due to its simplicity and as transformers’ central role in language foundation models, prompt tuning has been applied to some vision tasks for knowledge transfer, e.g., image classification [1, 29], detection and segmentation [45], but not yet for image synthesis. **3. Visual Prompt for Generative Transfer** Fig. 2 overviews the proposed generative transfer learn ing framework. We aim at transferring a generative prior, parameterized by generative vision transformers, while utilizing the same VQ encoder and decoder trained from the large source dataset. We use prompt tuning to adapt to the target distributions while leaving the transformer parameters frozen. We discuss how to learn visual prompts (Sec. 3.1), a new prompt generator for conditional image synthesis (Sec. 3.2), and a prompt design for generating visually diverse images (Sec. 3.3). **3.1. Learning Visual Prompt** A sequence of prompt tokens is prepended to the visual tokens to guide the pretrained transformer models to the target distribution. Prompt tuning, learning the parameters of the token generator, is optimized by gradient descent with respective loss functions, while fixing the parameters of the pretrained transformers. To be specific, let = _zi_ _i=1_ _Z_ _{_ _}[H][⇥][W]_ be a sequence of visual tokens (i.e., an output of VQ encoder followed by the vectorization) and _φ =_ _ps;φ_ _s=1_ _P_ _{_ _}[S]_ be a sequence of prompt tokens. For the AR transformer, the loss is given as follows: AR = Ex _P_ log P✓( _φ)_ (1) _L_ _⇠_ _X_ _−_ _Z|P_ _P✓(_ _φ) =_ _H⇥⇥_ _W_ _P✓(zi_ _z<i,_ _φ⇤)_ (2) _Z|P_ _i=1_ _|_ _P_ Y For the NAR transformer, we follow that of MaskGIT [7]: _LNAR = Ex⇠PX,M_ _⇠PM_ _−_ log P✓(ZM _|ZM_ _, Pφ)_ (3) _P✓(ZM_ _|ZM_ _, Pφ) =⇥_ _i_ _M_ _[P][✓][(][z][i][|Z][M]_ _[,][ P][φ]⇤[)]_ (4) _2_ Y where M ⇢{1, ..., H⇥W _} is a set of visual token indices_ sampled from a masking schedule distribution P, M is its _M_ complement, and _M =_ _zi_ _i_ _M_ . Prompt tuning proceeds _Z_ _{_ _}_ _2_ by minimizing the respective loss with respect to the prompt parameters φ while fixing the transformer parameters ✓: _φ[⇤]_ = arg min AR/NAR (5) _L_ ----- (a) Image synthesis using instance-conditioned prompts. Dog Dog (b) Image synthesis using a marquee header prompt between instance (blue) and class (red) conditioned prompts. (c) Image synthesis using a marquee header prompt between instance-conditioned prompts (blue and red). Figure 4. Iterative decoding of NAR transformers. (4a) instance prompts generate images of high-fidelity but with low diversity. Marquee header prompts enhance generation diversity by interpolating (4b) from instance to class prompts or (4c) between instance prompts. While we focus on the prompt tuning due to the virtue of effectiveness and compute-efficiency for large source transformers, we note that the proposed learning framework is amenable with other methods, such as adapter [28] or finetuning [35], with learnable prompts. See a detailed comparison in Appendix B.4. After prompt tuning, we generate visual tokens for image synthesis by iterative decoding. For AR transformer, 1: for i 1 to H ⇥ _W do_ 2: _zˆi_ _P✓(zi_ _zˆ<i,_ _φ)_ _⇠_ _|_ _P_ 3: end for dimension P . For example, when using a prompt of length _S=128, hidden P_ =768 and embedding dimension D=768, the token generator would introduce 10.4M parameters for _C=100 class conditions, as in Fig. 3c. The bottleneck oc-_ curs at the 3d weight tensor of size C⇥S⇥P . To make it parameter efficient, we propose a factorized token generator (Fig. 3b). We encode class and sequence position index via MLPC and MLPP with F factors, respectively. The MLP outputs are element-wise summed, multiplied by a 1d factor vector from MLPF, and reduced along the factor dimension. The output is then fed to MLPT to produce a prompt of length S. As in Fig. 3c, the number of parameters of the proposed architecture is greatly reduced, requiring only 0.76M parameters, down from 10.4M, for a prompt of length 128 when F = 1.[2] We empirically find that F = 1 is sufficient for NAR transformers. For AR transformers, extra capacity is needed by setting F = 16. Moreover, we build a new type of prompt tokens condi tioned on individual data instances, inspired by the instanceconditioned GAN [5]. We assign each data a unique index and map it into a distinct embedding via MLPC. When both class label and instance index are used, instance index is simply treated as an extra class, indexed from C. To train the model, we sample between class label and instance index. As we explain below in Sec. 3.3, instance-conditioned prompts add more fine-grained control on generation. **3.3. Engineering Learned Prompts** Given the wealth of learned prompts conditioned on the class and instance proposed in Sec. 3.2, we propose a new 2The proposed factorization can be extended to incorporate the “depth” position of deep visual prompt [29] to reduce the number of parameters. For the NAR model, parallel decoding [7] is used: **Require: M = {}, T**, {n1, ..., nT }, _t=1_ _[n][t][ =][ H][ ⇥]_ _[W]_ 1: for t 1 to T do 2: _zˆi_ _P✓(zi_ _M_ _,_ _φ),_ _i_ _M[P][T]_ _⇠_ _|Z_ _P_ _8_ _2_ 3: _M_ _M [ {arg topki 2 M_ _P✓(ˆzi|ZM_ _, Pφ), k = nt_ _}_ 4: end for [b] # $ where _n1, ..., nT_ is a masking schedule that decides the[b] _{_ _}_ number of tokens to decode at each step. We refer to [7] for details on decoding for NAR transformers. Illustrations of decoding steps for both models are in Fig. 2. **3.2. Prompt Token Generator Design** For transfer learning of discriminative tasks, prompts are designed without condition variables [29]. For generative tasks, it is beneficial to have condition variables (e.g., class, attribute) for better control in generation. We achieve this with a simple design of treating class conditions as another prompt, as in Fig. 3a. One critical issue is that the number of learnable param eters increases as the product of three factors: the number of classes C, the prompt sequence length S and the feature ----- |Model (# tr params)|Mean|Mean (10K)|C101|Flowers|Pet|DTD|Kitti|SUN|EuroSAT|Resisc| |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| |MineGAN [71] (88M) cGANTransfer [60] (105M)|151.5 85.1|114.0 63.8|102.4 89.6|132.1 61.6|130.1 48.6|87.4 70.3|117.9 48.9|77.5 31.1|111.5 45.6|81.0 50.3| |Prompt (S = 1) (0.67M) Prompt (S = 16) (0.68M) Non-Autoregressive Prompt (S = 128) (0.76M) Scratch (172M)|53.7 39.9 36.4 42.7|19.7 18.6 18.6 60.0|13.5 12.7 12.9 72.7|13.8 13.2 13.4 57.2|11.9 11.1 10.9 70.3|25.8 26.0 25.9 66.1|32.3 30.0 29.9 33.8|7.3 7.4 7.7 9.2|45.9 35.8 38.4 39.5|28.5 24.9 24.8 32.0| |Prompt (S = 1) (0.86M) Prompt (S = 16) (0.88M) Autoregressive Prompt (S = 256) (1.06M) Prompt (S = 256, F = 16) (5.16M) Scratch (306M)|73.2 47.4 39.0 36.9 39.6|44.1 34.5 32.3 26.6 61.8|45.4 41.4 39.6 27.2 76.0|28.9 19.6 17.3 14.1 56.1|42.2 36.6 34.9 27.2 52.5|37.1 33.4 32.5 30.0 92.7|66.8 41.4 37.1 34.6 31.6|18.8 16.4 15.0 12.8 13.5|37.3 32.6 29.6 26.4 19.4|35.1 28.8 26.7 22.2 29.5| Table 1.
